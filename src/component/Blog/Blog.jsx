              <p className='text-p'>Assuming you're referring to the "Context API" in React, it is a feature that allows components to share data without having to pass the data down through every level of the component tree as props.</p>

               <h1 className='text-2xl font-semibold pb-2'>2. What is custom hook ?</h1>
               <p className='text-p'>In React, a custom hook is a JavaScript function that uses built-in React hooks (such as useState, useEffect, and useContext) to provide reusable logic that can be shared between multiple components.</p>

              <p className='text-p'>In React, the useRef hook provides a way to create a mutable reference to a DOM element or a value that persists across renders of a component.</p>

               <p className='text-p'>In React, the useMemo hook is used to memoize a value, which means that it will only be recomputed when one or more of its dependencies have changed. This can help improve performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders of components that depend on expensive computations or complex data transformations.</p>
